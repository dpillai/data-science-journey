I'll create a structured checklist for tomorrow's 4:00-5:15 AM coding session and style it for easy reference.

# MONDAY MORNING SESSION: Agricultural Dictionary Data Processing

**Session Time:** 4:00-5:15 AM (75 minutes)
**Focus:** Dictionary Operations & Farm Data Management

## 🔄 Startup (5 mins)

- [x] Create new project directory `farm_management/`
- [x] Create new file `field_processor.py`
- [x] Open your Python environment

## 📋 Part 1: Basic Dictionary Operations (10 mins)

- [x] Create single field dictionary with basic properties
- [x] Practice accessing field name and crop type
- [x] Add a new planting date
- [x] Update yield value
- [x] Print all field information to verify structure

## 🌾 Part 2: Farm Data Structure (15 mins)

- [x] Create main `farm_data` dictionary with two sample fields
- [x] Add detailed input data for each field
- [x] Verify nested dictionary access
- [x] Add comments explaining data structure
- [x] Test printing specific nested values

## ⚙️ Part 3: Core Functions (20 mins)

- [x] Implement `calculate_total_acres()`
- [x] Test with sample data
- [x] Implement `estimate_yield_value()`
- [x] Add price dictionary for crops
- [x] Test yield calculations

## 🎯 Part 4: Challenge Functions (20 mins)

- [x] Implement `calculate_fertilizer_usage()`
  - [x] Track totals by fertilizer type
  - [x] Account for different field sizes
- [x] Implement `find_fields_by_criteria()`
  - [x] Add soil type filtering
  - [x] Add minimum acres filtering
- [x] Implement `calculate_input_costs_per_acre()`
  - [ ] Add input price dictionary
  - [x] Calculate per-acre costs

## ✅ Wrap-up (5 mins)

- [x] Save all code
- [x] Document any questions for 10:30 AM review
- [ ] Create notes on challenging concepts
- [ ] Push code to version control (if using)

## 📌 Success Criteria

Your morning session is complete when you can:

1. Add and modify field data in the dictionary structure
2. Calculate total acres by crop type
3. Estimate total yield value across all fields
4. Generate fertilizer usage reports
5. Filter fields by criteria
6. Calculate per-acre input costs

## 📝 Notes for 10:30 AM Review

```python
# Add questions/observations here during your session
1. `for k.v in dict.items()`
2.
3.
```

Would you like me to:

1. Break down any of these tasks into more detailed steps?
2. Add specific test cases for each function?
3. Include more agricultural-specific calculations or metrics?
